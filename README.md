# Treasure Hunt

#### Introduction

This project brings in ideas of graphical implementations in Python where we used PyGame and we also used search algorithms
for the robot to find the treasures that were the main goal. In our version of the project we focused less on the GUI
and mappings and rather fixated more on accomplishing the way the program runs by making calculations.

### Running the code
To run the code you must have the Python compiler installed as well as the PyGame library. In addition to this you'll need all the code + images which is provided in this repository.
